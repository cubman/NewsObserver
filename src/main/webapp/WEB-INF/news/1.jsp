    Colonising Mars
    Musk’s SpaceX enterprise was founded with the intention of making space travel affordable. By extension, Musk has stated that he hopes human beings will one day become a “multi-planetary species”. At the 68th International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide last September, Musk said he hopes to send cargo ships to the Red Planet within the next five years, with humans settling by 2024.

    Travelling at 700mph underground
    The Hyperloop high-speed train system has been dubbed a “cross between a Concorde, a railgun, and an air hockey table” by Musk, and will allow passengers to travel at over 700mph. Musk expects that the two routes he has so far proposed, Los Angeles to San Francisco and New York City to Washington DC, should take no longer than 30 minutes on a Hyperloop train.

    Powering the world
    Nicknamed the “alien dreadnought” by Musk, Tesla’s Gigafactory 1 is a huge battery factory in the middle of the Nevada desert. It is being constructed with the ambitious objectives of becoming the largest building in the world by footprint, at 540,000 sq m (5.8m sq ft), as well as producing almost the equivalent of the world’s entire current output of lithium-ion batteries.

    To turbocharge brains
    Elon Musk is a founding member of Neuralink, a company that intends to be a “merger of biological intelligence and machine intelligence” in developing technology to connect computers to our brains. The brain-computer interface (BCI) technology could be used for cognitive enhancement, ranging from improving memory and decision-making abilities to staving off the symptoms of Alzheimer’s.

    Playing with fire
    Despite widespread condemnation, Elon Musk’s Boring Company sold 20,000 flamethrowers at $500 each on preorder in January. The initiative saw Musk raise $10m in sales but some customers may be left out in the cold should customs authorities thwart the trade of the offensive weapons when they are due to be shipped out in the spring.

    Since you’re here …
    … we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever but advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. And unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall – we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters – because it might well be your perspective, too.

    I appreciate there not being a paywall: it is more democratic for the media to be available for all and not a commodity to be purchased by a few. I’m happy to make a contribution so others with less means still have access to information.
    Thomasine F-R.
    If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps fund it, our future would be much more secure. For as little as £1, you can support the Guardian – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.
